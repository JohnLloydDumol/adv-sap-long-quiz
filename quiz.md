## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
is an architectural strategy that makes it possible for software parts to communicate with one another and be reused through service interfaces. Services may be quickly integrated into new applications by using an architectural pattern and common interface standards.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
 A design paradigm known as Standardized Service Contract, Loose Coupling, and Service Actual leverages common systems to provide services to extra apps over the protocol; this is only an idea and isn't specified in certain programming languages. Supports loose coupling everywhere in the project. Supports interoperability. Increases the quality of service. Supports vendor diversity. Promotes discovery and federation. According to one of many definitions of SOA, a service has four properties
3. Define Microservices.
A subset of service-oriented architectures (SOA) known as microservices makes it possible for software systems to be adaptable and independently deployable. Microservices are controlled by tiny, independent teams and are frequently used for developing constantly deployed applications.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
 Independently manageable services Enables more and more services as the need arises Minimizes the impact on existing service Possible to change or upgrade each service individually rather than upgrading in the entire application Greater employee productivity
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
So the differences of SOA and Micoroservices are -Architecture, The software in a microservices architecture is made up of a number of little services, each of which carries out a specific task autonomously. Consequently, we may conclude that there is the least amount of resource sharing throughout the services. However, services in SOA are more expansive and try to share as many resources as they can.
6. Define Web Services.
The hundreds of thousands of different types of computers connected to several networks globally is known as the Internet. A web service is a standardized way for messages to be sent between client and server applications on the World Wide Web. A software module designed to perform a certain set of tasks is called a web service. Through the network, web services in cloud computing may be located and accessed.
The client that called the web service would be able to receive functionality from it.
7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
They can use HTTP to enable remote invocation and expose already-existing functions on the network.
They can facilitate the exchange of data and services across different applications by utilizing a common protocol, like XML.
They can make business-to-business integration easier and lower integration expenses.
They can make it possible for new business models and make use of current skill sets and technology.
They may be found using a straightforward method and utilized again for various objectives.
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
XML-based: Web services employ XML at the levels of data transmission and representation.
Loosely coupled: A web service user is not a direct subset of the web service.
Coarse-grained: Rather of using discrete techniques, web services deliver their services through sizable functional units.
Web services are capable of supporting both synchronous and asynchronous communication.
Web services have the capability to provide both structured content interchange and remote procedure calls.
9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
The three roles of service provider, service requester, and service registry interact within the architecture of a web service. The three operations—publish, find, and bind—are involved in the interaction. The web services artifacts are impacted by these roles and operations. The web service software module and its description make up the web service artifacts.
10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
Protocols for encoding data and messages in XML or JSON format and accessing online services are known as SOAP or REST.
WSDL: a language used to describe a web service's capabilities and user interface.
UDDI is a publishing and service discovery directory.
The program that provides the web service is the service provider.
The program that uses the web service is known as the service requester.
